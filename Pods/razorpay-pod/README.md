This repository implements pod for Razorpay's iOS Framework.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation | Docs

### Note:
We no longer support Swift 3 , moving forward only the latest version of swift will be supported.We only support a minimum deployment target of iOS 10+.This decision has been taken based on the following link that clearly shows that the number of devices running iOS 10 are very minimal.
https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/

### Note: 
We now support another optional parameter to the open method - displayController
When this parameter is specified , the razorpay controller will be pushed on to this controller's navigation controller if present or presented on this controller if absent.

For example, the swift call is 

```
razorpay.open(options, displayController: self)
```

### Note:
If your integrating this on OBJC please replace the line
```
#import <Razorpay/Razorpay.h>
```
with 
```
# import <Razorpay/Razorpay-Swift.h> in your viewcontroller.m file
```
